# Two Sum and Combination

This program takes an array of integers and a target value as input. It performs various operations to determine pairs of integers that sum up to the target value, merge the array into a single sorted array, and find combinations of digits that sum up to a doubled target value.

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers and a target value, the program performs the following steps:

1. Finds pairs of integers in the array that sum up to the target value.
2. Merges the pairs into a single array and sorts it in ascending order.
3. Doubles the target value.
4. Finds combinations of digits in the merged array that sum up to the doubled target value.

### Sample Input

out put ::
First Combination for "4": [[1, 3], [2, 2], [-4, 8], [-6, 2]]
Merge Into a Single Array: [-6, -4, 1,
